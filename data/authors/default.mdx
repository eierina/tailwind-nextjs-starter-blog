Welcome to my blog! I’m a seasoned blockchain developer with over 25 years of experience in software engineering. My journey has taken me through all sorts of programming languages, technologies, and domains. As a blockchain and Web3 enthusiast, I’m now focused on diving deeper into the complexities of blockchain technology.

This is a space for sharing insights, discoveries, and expertise in the ever-evolving blockchain landscape. I explore everything from the technical details of smart contracts, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), and security audits to the profitable opportunities offered by MEV (Maximal Extractable Value). Whether you’re a fellow developer, a blockchain enthusiast, or just curious about this field, I hope to provide valuable insights and practical guidance that combine mastery, exploration, and enjoyment.

Join me as I navigate the blockchain wave—balancing fun, profit, and technical innovation.
